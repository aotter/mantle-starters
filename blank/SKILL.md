# `blank` archetype

Follow the [Mantle install brief](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aotter/mantle/main/skills/install/SKILL.md). This file only adds archetype-specific register and product-shape hints.

## What this is

Headless CMS backend — API + MCP only, no public HTML. The user is bringing their own frontend (Next.js / Astro / SvelteKit / iOS / partner integration) and wants mantle purely as content + auth + MCP. Schema design happens **after** deploy through the `extend` skill.

## Interview probes to emphasize

- Confirm "bring your own frontend" explicitly. If the user expects public HTML, route them to `publication` instead.
- Which frontend? (Inform the editor first-prompt example so it references their stack.)
- What is the first Schema they want? (Defer the design; just capture the noun. They will design it through `extend`.)
- Will the frontend talk to `/mcp/staff` (write) or `/mcp` (read) — or both?

## Site defaults

- **Mood default:** from interview; no archetype-level default. The user is technical-leaning if they chose `blank`.
- **Ready-state wording:** technical-active. (zh-TW illustrative: "後端準備好了", "API 上線了"; EN illustrative: "the backend is up", "API is live". Match the user's own register.)
- **Avoid:** marketing voice; "your beautiful new site" language — they explicitly opted out of UI.

## Editor first-prompt template

```text
打開後台，先列出目前的 collections（example 應該還在）。再讓我看一下 /api/views/published-notes 在空 collection 下回什麼。然後 propose 一個第一個真正要用的 Schema 草稿 — 我會直接改 manifests YAML，不要 apply。
```

(EN illustrative:)
```text
Open the admin and list current collections (the example one should be there). Show me what /api/views/published-notes returns against an empty collection. Then propose a draft Schema for the first real one we'll use — I'll edit the YAML manifest directly; don't apply yet.
```

## Schema/View/Procedure extensions

Defer all schema design to [`skills/extend`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aotter/mantle/main/skills/extend/SKILL.md). The starter ships exactly one demo Schema/View (`notes` / `published-notes`); during install, do **not** add custom manifests. The user designs theirs after deploy.
