Reference `publication` starter for mantle v0.1.0 — the
owner-published-content family in the starter taxonomy (#58). Covers
landing pages, articles, docs-lite, project updates, and basic contact
capture. Not for inventory / order workflows (`micro-shop`), lead
qualification pipelines (`leads-inbox`), member-created content
(`community`), or private/paid creator content (`fan-club`).

It wraps the runtime + Cloudflare adapter into a runnable Worker with
three Schemas (posts, post-translations, contact-messages) and a
public read path served from KV. Schema-level names (`posts`,
`/posts` route, MCP tool names) are intentionally kept stable through
v0.1.0 even though the family rename happened — runtime route
behavior, seed scripts, MCP tool names, views, tests, and SEO paths
all key off these.

This starter is intentionally fixed-manifest during bootstrap. The
first-run installer should ask for public copy and, only after owner
approval, create initial home/about/contact/article content through
the normal MCP/admin authoring path. It should not redesign the
Schema/View/Procedure/Trigger model. Custom workflow design belongs
in a blank starter or a later starter family.

## What it exercises

- **Localized posts via `translates`** — `posts` is language-neutral
  (slug, cover image, author, publish time); `post-translations`
  carries per-locale title + body and joins on `slug`. ADR-0010 cross-
  Schema invariants run at boot.
- **Builtin Procedure** — `submit-contact` declares
  `handler.kind: builtin`, `op: create`, `schema: contact-messages`.
  The runtime projects input, stamps `x-clam-bind: now`, drops side-
  channel fields (CAPTCHA token), routes through the entry-writer
  chokepoint.
- **Lifecycle hooks** — `before_create` on `contact-messages` runs a
  CAPTCHA-check Procedure (`errorPolicy: abort`); `after_create` runs
  a Slack-notify Procedure (default `errorPolicy: continue`, rides
  `ctx.waitUntil` when CF supplies it).
- **Render pipeline** — entry HTML + per-locale `llms.txt` are written
  to KV at publish time by `HtmlPublishOrchestrator`. The starter
  serves them directly via a small KV-read handler in `src/index.ts`.

## What it does NOT do (deferred)

- **Member system** (end-user login, signup, password). Comments are
  the contact form's anonymous-with-email pattern — no member auth.
  Lands in v0.2.
- **Editorial lifecycle** (approval queue). Schemas use `lifecycle:
  simple` only. Editorial runtime lands in v0.1.x.
- **First-party media hosting**. `posts.coverUrl` is a hand-supplied
  URL string marked with `x-mcp-hint: media-image` for agents/admin UI.
  R2-backed uploads are an explicit opt-in add-on, not part of first-run
  provisioning.
- **Full admin SPA**. v0.1.0 ships a minimal owner landing at `/admin`.
  Real-user first content is created after provisioning, through
  agent interview + MCP/admin authoring. `fixture` and `seed:initial`
  are for tests and OSS contributor local dev, not the production
  onboarding path.

## Quickstart

To browse the **public site** locally (rendered publication routes, contact form,
MCP transport auth), one secret is required and nothing else needs to be touched:

```bash
pnpm install
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
```

Edit `.dev.vars` and fill in `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=` — without it the worker
returns `auth_not_configured` on every request. Generate a value:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
# copy the output, paste it after `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=` in .dev.vars
```

That's the only field you have to set for the public site. The `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
/ `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` / `ADMIN_GITHUB_LOGIN` placeholders left in `.dev.vars`
are only consumed when you click `/admin` — public routes ignore them. (See
[§ Signing in at /admin](#signing-in-at-admin) when you're ready.) `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY=dev-stub`
is fine for local development.

Seed demo content and start the dev server:

```bash
pnpm fixture       # one-time: seeds dev D1/KV with demo content (no staff row)
pnpm dev
```

Open <http://localhost:8787>. The root URL 302-redirects to your canonical
locale (`<!doctype html>` HTML, not a JSON error). Without `pnpm fixture` every
route 404s — the miniflare D1/KV start empty.

The fixture is intentionally demo-shaped. Use it only for local contributor
preview or smoke testing — real user sites should not inherit fixture copy
(production content comes from `pnpm run seed:initial` instead, see below).

### Signing in at /admin

`/admin` uses real GitHub OAuth even locally — there is no stub for the
browser redirect flow. One-time setup:

1. **Create a GitHub OAuth App** at <https://github.com/settings/developers>:
   - **Homepage URL**: `http://localhost:8787`
   - **Callback URL**: `http://localhost:8787/admin/auth/github/callback`
2. **Edit `.dev.vars`** (created above from `.dev.vars.example`):
   ```
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<the_client_id>
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<the_client_secret>
   ADMIN_GITHUB_LOGIN=<your_github_login>
   ```
3. **Restart `pnpm dev`** so wrangler picks up the new vars.
4. Visit <http://localhost:8787/admin> and sign in with the GitHub
   account whose login matches `ADMIN_GITHUB_LOGIN`. The runtime's
   `ensureBootstrapOwner` promotes that first user to `owner`
   automatically — the dev fixture intentionally leaves the staff
   table empty so this bootstrap fires.

The fixture re-runs cleanly while `wrangler dev` is up too — the
migrations are `IF NOT EXISTS` and inserts use `OR IGNORE`, so
edits to fixture text or templates land on subsequent applies.

Run order matters because `wrangler dev`'s D1 lives in memory
unless the fixture has populated `.wrangler/state` first; without
fixture data, every page returns 404.

### Integration smokes

```bash
cp .dev.vars.test.example .dev.vars.test   # one-time, gitignored
pnpm test:integration
```

`pnpm test:integration` orchestrates the test profile end-to-end:
spawns wrangler with `--env test --persist-to .wrangler-test --port 8788`,
applies the test fixture (which **does** pre-seed
`user(u-staff-1, role=editor)` plus a Better Auth MCP token with
`mcp:staff` scope so the Staff MCP smoke reaches the role-gated
authoring path — that's exactly what should NOT happen on the dev
profile), runs both smokes against port 8788, then tears
wrangler down.

The test profile has its own miniflare state (`.wrangler-test/`) and
its own port (8788), so it never collides with `pnpm dev` running on
the default profile (`.wrangler/`, port 8787). Both can run in
parallel.

For production onboarding, do not run the fixture and do not run
`seed-initial-content.ts` against `--remote`. Provision first, then
interview the site owner for public copy and ask whether they want
help drafting initial content. If they approve, create content
through MCP/admin authoring so the same operation path is exercised
from day one.

## Smoke test (curl)

```bash
# Public read — pre-rendered HTML from KV:
curl -i http://localhost:8787/en/posts/hello-world
curl -i http://localhost:8787/zh-TW/posts/hello-world

# Per-locale post list:
curl -i http://localhost:8787/en/posts

# llms.txt:
curl -i http://localhost:8787/llms.txt
curl -i http://localhost:8787/en/llms.txt

# Public View REST surface (ADR-0012). Every parsed View auto-mounts:
#   - recent-posts: static (no params)
#   - posts-by-locale: required ?locale= param
curl -s http://localhost:8787/api/views/recent-posts | jq '.data | {rows: .rows | length, page, show, hasMore}'
curl -s 'http://localhost:8787/api/views/posts-by-locale?locale=zh-TW' | jq '.data.rows[] | {slug, title}'
curl -s 'http://localhost:8787/api/views/posts-by-locale?locale=en&page=1&show=2' | jq '.data | {page, show, hasMore, count: .rows | length}'

# Contact form happy path (CAPTCHA passes):
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/contact \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"Alice","email":"a@example.com","message":"Hi","turnstileToken":"tok-pass"}'

# Contact form CAPTCHA fail path (the stub rejects token === "fail").
# Expect HTTP 403 with `{ ok: false, diagnostic: { code: AUTH_DENIED, ... } }`:
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/contact \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"Bot","email":"b@example.com","message":"spam","turnstileToken":"fail"}'

# Staff MCP smoke uses the test profile's pre-minted Better Auth MCP
# token. Local dev browser sign-in uses real GitHub OAuth; no stub
# bearer is accepted on the dev profile.
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8788/staff/mcp \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer fixture-mcp-access-token' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize"}'
```

`pnpm fixture` renders pre-published HTML for each post-translation
+ each per-locale list and writes both to KV alongside the D1 inserts
— the public read path serves immediately, no admin publish flow
required. The fixture is idempotent (D1 inserts use `OR IGNORE`; KV
puts overwrite). Re-running picks up edits to fixture text or to the
templates.

## Production checklist

Before deploying THIS starter as-is:

1. Production uses Better Auth with GitHub OAuth + MCP OAuth/DCR. Set real `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ADMIN_GITHUB_LOGIN`, and `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`. **Back `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` up in a secret manager** — Better Auth uses it to sign session cookies + JWTs and (if the JWT plugin is enabled) to encrypt JWK private keys at rest. Carrying the same value across host migrations keeps users signed in and JWK rows readable; rotating it logs everyone out and requires regenerating the JWK row. Use `BETTER_AUTH_SECRETS` (comma-separated, plural) when you need a graceful rotation window.
2. Replace `captchaCheck` with a real Turnstile / hCaptcha siteverify call.
3. Replace `slackNotify` with your Slack webhook (or a different sink).
4. Replace demo Unsplash cover images with assets you own when appropriate,
   or keep using external image URLs until first-party media hosting is enabled.
5. Bind real D1 and render KV namespaces in `wrangler.toml`; boot applies runtime migrations on first request.
6. Don't run `test/fixture/` against production — it is demo content for local dev.

## Production smoke recipe

End-to-end verification on a real Cloudflare account, ~20 min. Run this whenever the starter ships, an SDK release lands, or before declaring a v0.1.x release tag clean. Closes [#25](https://github.com/AotterClam/mantle/issues/25)'s production-smoke acceptance bullet.

Prerequisites:

- A Cloudflare account with billing profile (D1 + KV are free-tier; signup is the bar)
- A GitHub OAuth App configured with the Worker URL as both Homepage URL and `<worker_url>/admin/auth/github/callback` as Authorization Callback URL. The first deploy gives you `<worker_url>` so this is a two-pass setup; copy the Worker URL after step 4 below, register the OAuth App, then come back and set `wrangler secret put GITHUB_CLIENT_ID / GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET / ADMIN_GITHUB_LOGIN`.
- Node 20+, pnpm 9+, an empty target directory.

### Steps

1. **Bootstrap from prompt.** Paste [`docs/prompts/publication.en.md`](../../docs/prompts/publication.en.md) (or `publication.zh-TW.md`) into Claude Code / Cursor / Codex with placeholders filled in. The agent reads the install Skill, copies the starter, runs `setup:site`, and reports back a clean `pnpm validate` + `pnpm typecheck`.

2. **Contributor local smoke.** Before any Cloudflare provisioning,
   optionally use the fixture to verify the template itself:

   ```bash
   pnpm fixture
   pnpm dev
   curl -s http://localhost:8787/en/posts/hello-world | head -5     # expect <!doctype html>
   curl -s http://localhost:8787/api/views/recent-posts | jq '.data.rows | length'
   curl -s http://localhost:8787/llms.txt | head -1
   pnpm test:integration                                             # mcp-smoke + view-smoke
   ```

   All four must succeed for template release work. Do not treat this
   fixture content as user content.

3. **Provision Cloudflare resources** via the [provision Skill](../../skills/provision/SKILL.md). Creates D1 + render KV and writes their IDs into `wrangler.toml`. Verify `wrangler dev --remote` boots without binding errors.

4. **First deploy.**

   ```bash
   pnpm wrangler deploy
   # capture <worker_url> from the deploy output
   ```

5. **Register GitHub OAuth App** at <https://github.com/settings/developers> using `<worker_url>` and `<worker_url>/admin/auth/github/callback`. Then:

   ```bash
   pnpm wrangler secret put GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
   pnpm wrangler secret put GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
   pnpm wrangler secret put ADMIN_GITHUB_LOGIN     # your GH login
   pnpm wrangler secret put TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY   # real Turnstile secret
   ```

6. **Owner bootstrap + content interview.** Sign in as the owner, then
   connect an MCP-capable agent to the Staff MCP URL. The agent should
   ask the owner what initial content they want and whether it should
   write a first pass.

   Do not apply fixture or seed data to production. The
   `scripts/seed-initial-content.ts` helper is reserved for tests
   and contributor local dev — no longer exposed as a user-facing
   `pnpm` script.

7. **Public smoke against deployed worker.**

   ```bash
   curl -s "<worker_url>/<locale>/posts/<slug>" | head -5
   curl -s "<worker_url>/<locale>/posts/<slug>.md" | head -5    # markdown mirror
   curl -s "<worker_url>/api/views/recent-posts" | jq '.data.rows[] | {slug, title}'
   curl -s "<worker_url>/llms.txt"
   curl -s "<worker_url>/en/llms.txt"
   curl -s "<worker_url>/sitemap.xml" | head -10
   ```

   Use the slug the owner approved in step 6. All authored HTML routes
   return 200; the View REST endpoint returns the authored posts; both
   llms.txt variants exist; sitemap lists every locale × every
   published entry.

8. **Owner sign-in.** Visit `<worker_url>/admin` in a browser, sign in with GitHub. `ensureBootstrapOwner` promotes you to `owner` on first login because `ADMIN_GITHUB_LOGIN` matches.

9. **MCP operator smoke.** Open Claude Code / Cursor / Codex in any working directory; configure the MCP client with `<worker_url>/staff/mcp`. The first connection opens the consent screen — approve it with the same GitHub account.

   Then ask the agent to:

   ```text
   1. List entries in the posts collection.
   2. Create a draft post titled "Smoke test post" in en with slug "smoke-test"
      and a one-paragraph body.
   3. Publish it.
   4. Confirm the public HTML at <worker_url>/en/posts/smoke-test loads.
   5. Confirm the markdown mirror at <worker_url>/en/posts/smoke-test.md loads.
   6. Confirm the post appears in the recent-posts view.
   ```

   Every step must succeed. If `tools/list` doesn't show `create_draft_posts` / `request_publish` / etc., the boot validator failed silently — check `wrangler tail` for diagnostics.

10. **Cleanup.** Either keep the deployment as your real site or `wrangler delete` and clean up the OAuth App + KV / D1 resources. The smoke is reproducible from step 1.

### What this proves

- Pinned-Skill install path works end-to-end ([#22](https://github.com/AotterClam/mantle/issues/22))
- Provision + deploy creates real CF resources ([#23](https://github.com/AotterClam/mantle/issues/23))
- Standalone GitHub-only install + MCP smoke ([#24](https://github.com/AotterClam/mantle/issues/24))
- Blog/publication vertical end-to-end ([#25](https://github.com/AotterClam/mantle/issues/25))

### When this fails

- Step 2 fails: bug in the SDK or starter. File against the SDK; don't try to patch the consumer project.
- Step 6 content authoring fails: verify owner sign-in and Staff MCP auth first, then ask the owner whether to retry with a smaller first draft.
- Step 9 (MCP) fails: most likely the OAuth consent flow — verify the OAuth App's callback URL matches `<worker_url>/admin/auth/github/callback` exactly, no trailing slash mismatch.
